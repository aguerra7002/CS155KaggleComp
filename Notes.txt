Scores: 
Plain NN with regularization : .7784
RandomForest (2000 trees, 10 depth) : .7665
AdaBoost (50  'dumb' estimators) : .7809
AdaBoost (10 RF estimators): .7819 
AdaBoost (50 RF estimators): .7861
Adaboost (50 MLP estimators (128^3)): .7866

Notes: 
Data too low dimensional to make SVD worthwhile
Got rid of redundant rows
Normalized before testing.
ADABoost enhances every model we try it with.

Feature Engineering:
387 -> 4218
First deleted redundant data, then categorized the categorical data while leaving real valued features intact.
